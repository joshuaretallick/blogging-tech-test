# Blog App

For this technical challenge I have been tasked with creating a blogging app with multiple categories using this [ARTICLE](https://medium.com/@bruno_boehm/full-blog-app-tutorial-on-rails-zero-to-deploy-4c19e8174791) as the inspiration.
I am familiar with creating CRUD apps in Rails so after reading the article I created my own user stories which implement the key requirements of the outline, plus allow me the flexibility to add my own flair to the task.
Due to the time limitations I opted to use scaffolding where appropriate so I could ramp up the application quickly.

## Installation Instructions

- Clone Repo to your local machine
- From Command Line enter directory and then run:

```sh
bundle install
yarn
bundle exec rails db:migrate
bundle exec rails server
```

- Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Testing

I tested our app with Capybara and RSpec. Coverage, measured with SimpleCov, is at 96.7%

## User Stories
